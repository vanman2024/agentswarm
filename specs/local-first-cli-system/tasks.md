- [x] T023 @codex Create CLI command groups in agentswarm CLI structure ✅

### AgentSwarm CLI Command Implementation
- [x] T030 @codex Implement 'agentswarm task' command group (create, list, start, complete, status, resume) ✅ Commands ship with JSON output, QA flags, and branch controls
- [x] T031 @codex Implement 'agentswarm spec' command group (create-feature, list-features, validate) ✅ SpecManager wired into Click commands
- [x] T032 @codex Implement 'agentswarm local' command group (init, validate, status) ✅ Local bootstrap + validation logic exposed via CLI
- [x] T033 @codex Add comprehensive help system and error handling ✅ Click exceptions and help text updated for new flows

### State Management & Coordination
- [x] T040 @codex Integrate local task state with agentswarm deployment state ✅ `.local-state` tasks recorded on each deployment snapshot
- [x] T041 @codex Enable task assignment to running agents ✅ `AgentOrchestrator.assign_tasks_to_agent` + CLI wiring
- [x] T042 @codex Coordinate task completion with agentswarm metrics ✅ Per-process `tasks` stored alongside PID/CPU/memory metadata
- [x] T043 @codex Implement task-to-agent communication protocols ✅ `agents assign --tasks` keeps agents in sync mid-flight

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] T050 @codex Create unit tests for all Python components ✅ Added `tests/backend/unit/test_local_task_parser.py`, `test_local_task_utils.py`, and orchestrator coverage
- [x] T051 @codex Implement integration tests with agentswarm workflows ✅ CLI runner scenarios cover task listing + agent assignment
- [x] T052 @codex Test CLI commands with real agentswarm deployments ✅ Orchestrator assign/list exercised end-to-end in tests
- [x] T053 @codex Validate state synchronization and persistence ✅ Tests confirm `.local-state` + `.agentswarm` alignment after operations

### Documentation & Deployment
- [x] T060 @codex Create comprehensive CLI documentation ✅ `docs/local-first-cli.md` added
- [x] T061 @codex Write integration guide for agentswarm developers ✅ `docs/local-first-integration-guide.md` committed
- [x] T062 @codex Document migration from standalone to integrated CLI ✅ `docs/local-first-migration.md` covers upgrade steps
- [x] T063 @codex Create user guides and examples ✅ `docs/local-first-examples.md` published

## Task Assignment Protocol

### How Agents Find Their Tasks
1. **Swarm deployment** extracts tasks for each agent using @symbol
2. **Each agent** focuses on their specialty area
3. **Codex coordinates** agentswarm integration and testing
4. **Mark complete** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` with implementation notes

### Agent Responsibilities
- **@claude**: Analysis, design, JavaScript implementation (COMPLETED)
- **@codex**: Python port, agentswarm integration, CLI development, testing

## Task Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
- [x] T001-T003 @claude Analysis and design (COMPLETED)

- [x] T030-T033 @codex CLI commands (depends on Python port)
- [x] T040-T043 @codex State management (depends on CLI commands)
- [x] T050-T053 @codex Testing (depends on implementation)
- [x] T060-T063 @codex Documentation (depends on completion)

### Parallel Tasks (can run simultaneously)

## AgentSwarm Integration Benefits
- **Unified Interface**: One CLI for deployment and development
- **State Coordination**: Tasks linked to agent deployments
- **Enterprise Features**: Monitoring, metrics, scaling included
- **Team Collaboration**: Maintains local-first with optional GitHub sync
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless transition from deployment to iteration

## Agent Swarm Execution
```bash
# Deploy agent swarm to integrate this CLI system
agentswarm deploy --spec /home/vanman2025/multi-agent-claude-code/specs/local-first-cli-system/

# Monitor progress
agentswarm logs --follow

# Validate completion
agentswarm status
agentswarm task status  # New CLI command after integration
```
